Github CodeBuild Webhook
------------------------

This project will setup an api gateway endpoint, which you can have your github repository connect to. This will start and update a commit with the current build status.
This will be triggered for any PR update, on any branch.

!WARNING!
---------
This repo is no longer maintained, codebuild nowadays has native Github integration, please use that.

Installation
------------
Use the steps below to launch the stack directly into your AWS account. You can setup as much stacks as you want, as the stack is currently connected to 1 CodeBuild project.

1. First, we'll need to setup an [AWS CodeBuild](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/home) project. Create a new project in the AWS console, and be sure to add a [`buildspec.yml`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html) file to your project with some steps. Here's an [example](https://github.com/svdgraaf/webhook-test/blob/master/buildspec.yml).
2. Create a github api token in your account here, so that the stack is allowed to use your account: [https://github.com/settings/tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). You can ofcourse choose to setup a seperate account for this.
3. Deploy the stack:

	(or use `sls deploy`).

4. Create a Pull Request on your project, and see the magic be invoked ðŸ˜Ž
5. ...
6. Profit!

Architecture
------------
![Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svdgraaf/github-codebuild-webhook/master/architecture.png)

When you create a PR, a notification is send to the Api Gateway endpoint and the lambda step function is triggered. This will trigger the start of a build for your project, and set a status of `pending` on your specific commit. Then it will start checking your build status every X seconds. When the status of the build changes to `done` or `failed`, the github api is called and the PR status will be updated accordingly.

Example output
--------------
In the Example below, a PR is create, and a build is run which fails. Then, a new commit is pushed, which fixes the build. When you click on the 'details' link of the PR status, it will take you to the CodeBuild build log.

Todo
----
* Add (optional) junit parsing, so it can comment on files with (possible) issues.
* Perhaps make build project dynamic through apigateway variable if possible
